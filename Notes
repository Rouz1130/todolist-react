Building App Structure: Tying up the various visuals with underlying data is where the real work lies.
Divided up into 5 parts:
1:Adding something/items
2:Displaying something/items
3:Styling
4:Removing something/items
5:Animating something/items as they are Created or Deleted.

*: Individually all of these details are easy to wrap our brain around./Keep in mind when we put them together there are a few things to watch for.

1:Adding items:
-Setting up even 'handlers' and default form handling behavior's. onSubmit ={this.addFoo}. *note if a button exists with the type="submit" we reference the 'onSubmit'
in our form.
-Add Event handler like above example
-Create addItem event handler that gets called once submitted. Do so by adding a constructor below the class declaration. *keywords for constructor with react are 'props' and 'super' and 'ref'.
